      <h1>How the Real Estate Management System Works</h1>
      <p class="intro">
        This platform connects businesses, landlords, and clients into one seamless ecosystem. 
        Every action is secure, auditable, and designed for transparency.
      </p>
    </header>

    <section class="works-section">
      <h2>1. Security & Data Protection</h2>
      <p>
        The system is built with a privacy-first approach. All inputs are validated and sanitized 
        to prevent XSS or injection attacks. Passwords are hashed before storage, and sensitive 
        credentials (like M-Pesa and SendGrid keys) are loaded securely from environment variables. 
        Every transaction is logged in JSON files, ensuring auditability and traceability.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="works-section">
      <h2>2. Business Dashboard</h2>
      <p>
        Administrators oversee the entire platform through the business dashboard. They can monitor 
        listings, landlords, payments, bookings, valuation, revenue, and analytics. This ensures 
        profitability, compliance, and operational transparency.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="works-section">
      <h2>3. Landlord Onboarding & Payouts</h2>
      <p>
        Landlords register securely and access their personalized dashboard. They can manage property 
        listings, track payments, and view analytics. When clients make payments, the system calculates 
        commissions and remits landlord payouts via M-Pesa. Payouts can be directed to Paybill, Till, 
        or directly to a phone number using B2B or B2C integrations. Balances are updated instantly 
        in <code>landlords.json</code>, ensuring landlords always see accurate earnings.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="works-section">
      <h2>4. Client Journey</h2>
      <p>
        Clients browse available houses in the shop using a responsive, auto-sliding grid. They can 
        book properties, confirm details, and proceed to checkout. Bookings are validated and stored 
        in <code>bookings.json</code>, ensuring accuracy and trust. Clients receive instant feedback 
        on successful payments, along with confirmation emails.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="works-section">
      <h2>5. Payment Flow</h2>
      <p>
        During checkout, the system validates the booking, calculates commission, and remits landlord 
        payouts via M-Pesa. Transactions are recorded in <code>payments.json</code>, <code>sales.json</code>, 
        and <code>landlords.json</code>. This ensures financial accountability. Clients see immediate 
        confirmation, while landlords’ balances update in real time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="works-section">
      <h2>6. Auditability & Transparency</h2>
      <p>
        Every step — from registration to payment — is recorded. JSON-based storage ensures that 
        auditors and collaborators can trace actions clearly. This design enforces accountability 
        and builds trust across all stakeholders. The system is designed to be scalable, secure, 
        and transparent for long-term growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        This data is thereafter migrated to the cloud via a non-relational database where it is stored to be used by the system at any time of need
