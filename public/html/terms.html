      <h1>Commission Policy & Terms</h1>
      <p class="intro">
        This page explains why the business sets commission deductions, the terms and conditions for usage, 
        and the freedom landlords have to choose whether to use the system.
      </p>
    </header>

    <section class="privacy-section">
      <h2>1. Why Commission Is Required</h2>
      <p>
        The commission charged by the business ensures sustainability of the platform, covering transaction 
        processing, system maintenance, customer support, and continuous improvements. Without this deduction, 
        the system cannot guarantee secure payouts, audit-ready records, and reliable service for all users.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="privacy-section">
      <h2>2. Terms & Conditions for Businesses</h2>
      <p>
        Businesses using this platform agree that commissions are deducted automatically from tenant payments 
        before landlord payouts. The rate is set by the business and may vary depending on operational costs 
        and service agreements. All deductions are transparent and recorded in <code>payments.json</code> and 
        <code>sales.json</code> for accountability.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="privacy-section">
      <h2>3. Landlord Freedom of Choice</h2>
      <p>
        Landlords are free to decide whether to use this system. No one is compelled to adopt it, and participation 
        is entirely voluntary. By choosing to use the platform, landlords accept the commission deductions as part 
        of the service agreement. Those who prefer alternative arrangements may opt out without penalty.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="privacy-section">
      <h2>4. Transparency & Accountability</h2>
      <p>
        Every transaction — from tenant payment to landlord payout — is logged and auditable. This ensures that 
        landlords, businesses, and auditors can clearly trace deductions and payouts. The design enforces 
        accountability and builds trust across all stakeholders.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="privacy-section">
  <h2>5. Client Complaints & Landlord Conduct</h2>
  <p>
    The business reserves the right to investigate repeated client complaints about a specific landlord. 
    If such complaints are verified and deemed serious, the landlord may be permanently restricted from 
    using the system. This measure protects tenants, preserves trust, and ensures the platform remains 
    fair and reliable for all stakeholders.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="privacy-section">
  <h2>6. Fair Use & Accountability</h2>
  <p>
    Landlords are expected to uphold professional standards when using the system. Any misuse, fraudulent 
    activity, or consistent negative feedback from clients will be treated as a breach of terms. The business 
    may suspend or terminate access without refund to safeguard the integrity of the platform. By choosing 
    to use the system, landlords agree to these conditions and accept responsibility for their conduct.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="privacy-section">
  <h2>7. Client Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>
    Clients are required to sign out of the system when leaving a house to ensure accurate records 
    and proper release of the booking. This prevents unauthorized use and maintains transparency 
    between tenants, landlords, and the business.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="privacy-section">
  <h2>8. Payment Conditions</h2>
  <p>
    Clients must not make any payments unless they have communicated directly with the landlord 
    and received onboarding or confirmation for the specific house they are booking. This ensures 
    that tenants only pay for verified bookings and prevents fraudulent or mistaken transactions.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="privacy-section">
  <h2>9. Why Deposits Are Required</h2>
  <p>
    Deposits are collected at the time of booking to secure the house and protect both tenants 
    and landlords. For tenants, the deposit guarantees that the house will be reserved and not 
    offered to others while onboarding is completed. For landlords, it provides assurance that 
    the tenant is committed to the booking. Deposits are recorded transparently and may be 
    refundable according to the landlord’s terms.
